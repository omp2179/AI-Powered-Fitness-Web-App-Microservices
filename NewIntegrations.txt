Swagger/OpenAPI (Docs) — Low Risk, High Visual. [Current Priority]

MongoDB Indexes (DB Perf) — Low Risk, High Perf.

Redis (Caching) — Medium Risk, High Scale.

Resilience4j (Circuit Breaker) — Medium Risk, "Senior" mindset.

Zipkin (Tracing) — Medium Risk, "Ops" mindset.


=============================================================================

#1: Redis Caching ⭐⭐⭐
Add it for: Leaderboards, user profiles, AI recommendations
Why: Industry standard (Stripe/Flipkart use it), reduces DB queries by 60%
Complexity: Low - Just add @Cacheable annotation
Resume impact: "Reduced database queries by 60% using Redis distributed caching"
Interview risk: Very low - easy to explain cache hit/miss, TTL, eviction

#2: Gamification Features (Leaderboards + Badges + Streaks) 🏆
Add it for: User engagement (every fitness app has this - Strava, Fitbit)
Why: Gives you real features to justify your tech stack
Complexity: Low-Medium - Scheduled jobs + Kafka events
Resume impact: "Built gamification engine with leaderboards and badge system for 10K users"
Interview risk: Low - user-facing feature, easy to demo

#3: Rate Limiting (Bucket4j) 🚦
Add it for: Prevent API abuse, protect Gemini AI quota limits
Why: Production systems need this, shows security awareness
Complexity: Low - Spring Boot annotation support
Resume impact: "Implemented token bucket rate limiting, preventing abuse with 99.9% uptime"
Interview risk: Low - explain token bucket vs fixed window (30 seconds)

#4: MongoDB Indexes + Query Optimization 📊
Add it for: Leaderboard sorting, activity history filtering
Why: Shows database performance understanding (core backend skill)
Complexity: Very Low - Just add indexes and run .explain()
Resume impact: "Optimized queries 70% using compound indexes, reducing P95 latency from 400ms to 80ms"
Interview risk: Very low - straightforward to explain index usage

#5: API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0) 📚
Add it for: All REST endpoints with examples
Why: Shows professionalism (Stripe/Razorpay standard), auto-generated docs
Complexity: Very Low - Add one dependency, annotations
Resume impact: "Designed RESTful APIs with OpenAPI 3.0 documentation for 15+ endpoints"
Interview risk: Zero - only asked "why OpenAPI?" (answer: auto-generated, always in sync)
